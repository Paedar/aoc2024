# Advent of Code 2024

These are my implementations of the Advent of Code 2024.

Language: Java
Version: 23
Preview Features enabled: Yes

## Unit tests
I build unit tests out of every scenario, both of the example input on the assignment and of the actual input given.
This way I can refactor useful code into utility code whenever I wish and still have functioning solutions. If you want
to see my 'original' solutions you're welcome to use the git history.
